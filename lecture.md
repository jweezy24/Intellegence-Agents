What are Intelligence Agents?
-----------------------------
In a article in the "Modeling and Simulation: the Computer Science of Illusion" journal. Jacques Ferber defines a agent as, "An agent can be a physical or virtual entity that can act, perceive its environment (in a partial way) and communicate with others,is autonomous and has skills to achieve its goals and tendencies." A agent is usually given a set of given tasks it is meant to solve. One agent is just a agent on a system. Where as if the system contains more than one agent the system is referred to as a "Multi-agent system"(MAS). With these definitions I can now define a intelligence agent. A intelligence agent is a agent that is meant to be dynamic and adapt to it's environment. An example I can give would be efficient data mining. Data mining with decision making logic that adapts to the data set with multiple agents is an intelligent MAS.
