# What are Agents?

 Jacques Ferber defines an agent as, " a physical or virtual entity that can act, perceive its environment (in a partial way) and communicate with others,is autonomous and has skills to achieve its goals and tendencies." In other words, an agent is usually given a set of tasks that it should solve. Those tasks are given in an environment that changes. The agent in question should adapt to those new changes. The agent's result should change when the environment changes. One agent is just a agent on a system. Where as if the system contains more than one agent the system is referred to as a "Multi-agent system"(MAS).

# Environments for Agents:

Agents are measured by their performance in the environment they were built for. Thus, there are a multitude of criteria a environment can be judged on. Agents are evaluated by how well they are able to manage the several pieces of their their environment. How the environment is described depends on how it fairs with five categories. We will first look at accessibility.

### Accessibility
How accessible a agent is depends on its sensory apparatus. So accessibility is graded on how well the agent's sensors evaluate the environment. An agent that is built for all aspects of it's environment means the environment is very accessible. You can look at accessibility as how well the agent interprets the environment. A human example of evaluating accessibility lies within Northwestern running-backs. Northwestern recruiters are known for picking a running-back that thinks before they run. Meaning, Northwestern running-backs are know for path finding. The way the runner evaluates their path is based on how well they deal with the data they are given. The recruiters look for how well the runner observes the field. Thus, a vital piece to a Northwestern running back is based on how well the runner deals with their sensory feedback. Thus, Northwestern recruiters look for a runner that is very accessible to the field. The best players that are accessible judge their environment quickly. Agents are judged on accessibility in the same sense. An agent's accessibility also depends on speed. The better the agent's sensors fair in a environment the more accessible the environment.

### Determinism
Determinism describes is how complex the environment is for the agent. A deterministic and accessible environment means that there is very little uncertainty. As in, there is very space for random events to occur. Designing an agent for a highly deterministic and accessible environments are much easier than the non-deterministic types. Linear video games are a great example of highly deterministic environments. The word linear refers to the domino effect of events that are planned out. So, designing AI for these kinds of games tends to be easier than a game that is open ended. When the developers know for a fact that the player will enter a room with a very similar level of progression; the AI has a much smaller set of scenarios to prepare for. Unlike if the game was open ended. Open ended games have a level of randomness to them. A player can enter a level at anytime. Thus, the AI must be ready for all scenarios that could occur. Although, open ended games aren't the best counter example because any video game has finite planned events. A better example of a non-deterministic environment is the stock market. Anything in the human world can happen. Any agent, no matter how smart, will not be prepared for a Donald Trump tweet.

### Episodic
When looking how episodic an environment is we have to think of events as "episodes". Unlike television shows, these episodes are often completely separate with no overarching narrative the agent must prepare for. Meaning, a very episodic environment does not need to think ahead. If we relate these episodic events back to TV, a more episodic environment would be a situation comedy (sitcom). Each episode of a sitcom usually doesn't build off the last. The plot has to do with the situation of each episode. Just like with agents, the same logic applies. An entirely episodic environment though might not even share the same cast episode to episode.

### Static
A environment could be either static or dynamic. A static environment will not change while a agent is working. Where as a dynamic environment will change at any point in time. Static environments are much easier to deal with. As the agent no longer has to worry about the environment as it's working. Agents could queue up events as they come in and only have to check the environment before and after dealing with an event.If the environment does not change with the passage of time but the agent does, we call that semidynamic.

### Discrete
How discrete an environment is how many events are possible within the environment. The opposite of discrete environment is a continuous environment. It sounds similar to to determinism but determinism discusses the complexity of the situation rather than the events that the situation embodies. For example, video games are deterministic and discrete. Although, when the players are pinned against each other the game can become continuous. One type of game that is very continuous in nature are fighting games. Their environments are very deterministic. As in, the rules within a fighting game's environment are simple and will not change. Actually playing the game against a person is a different story. A human player can do something completely out of left field that even with years of experience and practice one may still be caught off guard. Where as a game like chess is very discrete. The set of possible scenarios is finite. Making chess more discrete.

# Designing for Environments

## Simple Environments
![Figure 1](/images/basicDesign.png)

Environments can range from being as simple as reacting to a packet or can be as complex as reacting to the stock market. Agents are made to deal with specific environments. Most agents will be designed like the diagram above. The figure above is suited for a environment that is very discrete, static, deterministic, episodic, and accessible. You can see how linear the process is for a simple agent. In the most simple situation the system would only need a single agent waiting in a thread.

## Complex Environments
![Figure 2](/images/complexDesign.png)

The image above describes a agent that adapts to it's environment as it is read in. As you can see there is a lot more going on. For one, the simple diagram doesn't have to be multi-threaded. Where as, the complex diagram has to be multi-threaded if the user wishes to have fast and accurate results. Also, what is commonly done with a complex environment is multiple agents will be needed thus the system will become a MAS. So complex environments need more from agents. Thus, to deal with a dynamic, continuous, non-deterministic environment. We need to observe what is commonly referred to as an intelligence agent.
