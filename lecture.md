What are Intelligence Agents?
-----------------------------
 Jacques Ferber defines an agent as, " a physical or virtual entity that can act, perceive its environment (in a partial way) and communicate with others,is autonomous and has skills to achieve its goals and tendencies." In other words, an agent is usually given a set of tasks that it should solve. Those tasks are given in an environment that changes. The agent in question should adapt to those new changes. The agent's result should change when the environment changes. One agent is just a agent on a system. Where as if the system contains more than one agent the system is referred to as a "Multi-agent system"(MAS). An example I can give would be AI helpers such as Alexa and Siri. They are idle workers when no requests are given. When they receive a request, they use natural language processing and internet data to give feedback. Self driving cars are another example of intelligence agents as they use GPS software to pick routes. They also can adapt to traffic as the traffic happens.

Levels of Agents:

Intelligence agents are sorted into categories based on how smart they really are.
